 * cityman's CAF thermal-engine has a DT_NEEDED on this library, so the
 * process cannot even start without a file of this name on vendor. The
 * 8994 conf applies cluster / GPU / LCD / battery policy through
 * libthermalioctl and sysfs. MP-CTL profile switches are optional and
 * are resolved with dlsym("perf_lock_use_profile"); returning -1 there
 * is "no profile", not a crash.
 *
 * This is the same approach Lineage uses on LGE devices when perfd is
 * not shipped. It is not a dummy thermal-engine.
